About Singapore MRT Lah 3.0

What's the first thing you do when you step out from the train? Looking left and right? That's right! Looking for the escalator to exit the MRT or change to another train and by the time one reaches the escalator, one will be "queuing" to proceed taking the escalator.

I do also believe that most of us had seen before cases whereby there's a lot of people crowding at a particular door before they alight at the next stop.

Wait no more! Introducing MRTLah! It's the very FIRST application which direct you to the nearest door to the escalator(s), lift(s) and even stair(s) no matter which station you're at! Just imagine the escalator(s), stair(s) and lift right at your "doorstep" when stepped out of the train!

I personally face this problem of locating the escalator(s) whenever I travel to different places and especially when I'm in a rush, nobody ain't have time to "queue" to take the escalator.

Hopefully with this application, it would help you guys to "save" time ;) If you have any suggestion(s) or feedback(s) for MRTLah, I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to send an email regarding any issue(s) you're facing :) Cheers~

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
